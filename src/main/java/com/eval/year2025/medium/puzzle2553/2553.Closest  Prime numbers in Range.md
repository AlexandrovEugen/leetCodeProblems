Given two positive integers 'left' and 'right', find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:
 * left <= num1 <= num2 <= right
 * both num1 and num2 are prime numbers.

num2 - num1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.

Return the positive integer arr = {num1, num2}
