You are given a double linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, previous pointer, and additional **child pointer**.
This child pointer my or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing this special nodes. These child may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a **multilevel data structure** as shown in the example below.

Given the **head** of the first level of the list, **flatten** the list so the all nodes appear in a **single-level**, doubly linked list. Let **curr** be a node with the child list. The nodes in the child list should appear **after** curr and before curr.next in the flatten list.
Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to **null**.
