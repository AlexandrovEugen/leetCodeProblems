## Description

You are give **0-indexed** 2d matrix grid of size mxn where (r,c) represents:
* A land cell if grid(r,c) = 0;
* A water cell containing grid(r,c) fish, if grid(r,c) > 0;

A fisher can start at any water cel (r,c) and can do the following operations any numbers of times:
* Catch all the fish at the cell (r,c) or
* Move to any adjacent water cell.

Return the maximum number of fish fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally, or 0 if no water cell exists.

An adjacent cell of the cell (r, c) is one of the cells: (r +1, c), (r - 1, c), (r, c + 1), (r, c-1) if it exists

    public int findMaxFish(int[][] grid) {
        int maxFish = 0;
        int[][] visited = new int[grid.length][grid[0].length];

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                maxFish = max(maxFish, dfs(i, j, grid, visited));
            }
        }

        return maxFish;
    }

    private int dfs(int i, int j, int[][] grid, int[][] visited) {
        int res;
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == 0 || visited[i][j] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        visited[i][j] = 1;
        res = grid[i][j];
        int [][] neighbors = new int[][]{{i - 1, j}, {i + 1, j}, {i, j - 1}, {i, j + 1}};
        for (int[] neighbor : neighbors) {
            int nr = neighbor[0];
            int nc = neighbor[1];
            res += dfs(nr, nc, grid, visited);
