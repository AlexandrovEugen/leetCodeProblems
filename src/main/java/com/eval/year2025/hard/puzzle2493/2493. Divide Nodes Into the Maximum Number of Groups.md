## Description

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.
Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.



***

## Solution:

Let's try to BFS to every vertices and caclulate for each the number of groups it possibly could create. 
Then add as a result the group with the maximum number
